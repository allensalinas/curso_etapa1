# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course
---
#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview

This is the result of the Mobile Specialist Certification Course. Here I've applied too many things I've learned, such as:
- Service Worker api
- IDB api
- Cache api
- Responsive design 
- Web Front Tooling:
  - npm
  - gulp
    -gulp-concat
    -gulp-clean-css
    -gulp-minify
-And other cool stuff.

The app is about a list of restaurants, which you can review and mark as favorite.

Feel free to use and contact me if you have any question.
